3. I will add pictures related to Girl Scouts and different kinds of badges, cookies, and activities we do. I don't know what music I could use, but definitely something upbeat or happy. The main text and background colors will be green and white, with accent colrs such as purple or blue.

4. I expect to use pictures, colors, fonts, and maybe music or animation in my website. I will most likely try and set it up like a calendar, and have an area that we can use just to write information down on.

1. My website is used to track my Girl Scout Troop's progresss. Girl Scouts is a girl-based group that revolves around helping girls be more confident in themselves, helping change the world, learning useful skils, and spreading positivity. It has a badges system, a cookie selling system, and lots of other fun activities.
   Girl Scoutss revolves around girls. It has journeys and badges that revole around helping girls be more outgoing and confident, and there are awards that are made to have a lasting effect on other people. Badge are earned by completing a specific set of tasks that revolve around a subject, such as cooking, writing, programming, outdoor skills, or pet care. Badges usually take only a few meetings, 2-4 hours, but some take longer to complete. Journeys are kind of like badges, but much lnger, with many more steps, and more indepth. They often focus on broader topics such as artistic abiilities and navigating the world of today as a teenager. They don't focus on a particullar skill, but on a main idea that goes indepth on many different things surrounding the main idea. There are three awards to earn. Bronze, silver, and gold. A gold award is the highest thing you can earn in Girl Scouts. It is something that you make/do that has a long lasting effect on those around you and involved with it. Near the beginning of the year, we sell cookies. Girls of all ages can sell them to earn prrizes, earn cookie dough money, and help people get what they need. Money earned from cookie selling often goes to food banks.
