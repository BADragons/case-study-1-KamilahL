Assignment 1


1. My website is going to be a personal website called 'My Troop Calendar'. It's purpose is to keep track of my girl scout troop's information. This includes the badges we have already completed, the badges we are working on at the monent and what we need to do or have already done to complete them, and the badges we want to do in the future. It will also keep track of our troop cookie selling data, as well as any activities that are coming up, and other miscellaneous informtaion we need. The targeted audience is girls around the ages of 13-18 years old that are interested in or participating in Girl Scouts, and young adults or adults that are troopleaders, volunteers, or have a child interested in or participating in girl scouts.

2. This website will help me keep track of wich badges we are on, cookie sale rates, and other activities/information we need to keep track of.

3. I will add pictures related to Girl Scouts and different kinds of badges, cookies, and activities we do. I don't know what music I could use, but definitely something upbeat or happy. The main text and background colors will be green and white, with accent colrs such as purple or blue.

4. I expect to use pictures, colors, fonts, and maybe music or animation in my website. I will most likely try and set it up like a calendar, and have an area that we can use just to write information down on.

5. My website URL would be 'GSTroopCalendar.com'. It explains what my website is about, and is easy to remember.

A1. My website is used to track my Girl Scout Troop's progresss. Girl Scouts is a girl-based group that revolves around helping girls be more confident in themselves, helping change the world, learning useful skils, and spreading positivity. It has a badges system, a cookie selling system, and lots of other fun activities.

A2. Girl Scouts revolves around girls. It has journeys and badges that revole around helping girls be more outgoing and confident, and there are awards that are made to have a lasting effect on other people. Badge are earned by completing a specific set of tasks that revolve around a subject, such as cooking, writing, programming, outdoor skills, or pet care. Badges usually take only a few meetings, 2-4 hours, but some take longer to complete. Journeys are kind of like badges, but different. Their main goal is to create or do something to help solve a problem. They don't focus on a particullar skill, but on a main idea that goes indepth on many different things surrounding the main idea. There are three awards to earn. Bronze, silver, and gold. A gold award is the highest thing you can earn in Girl Scouts. It is something that you make/do that has a long lasting effect on those around you and involved with it. Near the beginning of the year, we sell cookies. Girls of all ages can sell them to earn prrizes, earn cookie dough money, and help people get what they need. Money earned from cookie selling often goes to food banks.

A3. Which level of girl scout you are depends on your grade level. During kindergarten to first grade, you are a Daisy. During Second to third grade, you are a brownie. As a fourth and fith grader, you are a junior. For Sxth, seventh, and eighth graders are cadettes. Nineth and 10th graders are seniors, and 11th and 12th graders are ambassadors. When you go up a level, do do this ceremony called 'Bridging'. You basically cross the bridge from one level and arrive at the next. Each badge has multiple steps to complete. And in each step, there are different options to do. Some steps even have multiple steps in each option. After doing each step in  order, you can finish the badge. Once you do this, you get a physical badge to put on your vest/sash. Each level of Girl Scouts has different badges depending on what the age range is. The older and higher the group, the more complicated and longer the badges are. Most only take a few meets to complete, but some take more. And some badges require you to do activities such as visit a place, or go camping. Journeys are much harder than badges. While a troop can do a bunch of badges in a year, they can only do one or maybe two journeys. Journeys use the scientific method of sorts. They ask a question, brainstorm ideas to solve the problem, create a plan, follow through with that plan, record what the learned and what they'll do next, and share their findings. It is like a more simplified version of the scientific method. Topics include, but are not limited to, relationships and how to get along with others, animals and the environment, multi-media and the web, and making the world a better place for us. There are three different awards to earn; the bronze, silver, and gold awards. The Bronze award can only be earned at the junior level, the Silver award can only be earned at the Cadette level, and the Gold award can be earned at the Senior and Ambassador levels.

Assignment 3

1. 

2. My targeted audiences include female teens that have an interest in girl scouts, and both female and male adults that are interested in leading and volunteering. They will most likely want a website to visit that has the information on a troop. The writing needs to be clear and easy to read, and not too long. If I were visitiing my website, I would espect the design to be lively and cheerful, but not so much that I can't concentrate on anything else. I expect the website to be cleary organized, and have a clean look to it. As for content, I would want to see a few things. First off, I would want information on the troop running the website. I need information on who is in the troop, basically the amount of girls, and the level we are. I would want informtation on badges and how they complete them, if I wasd  looking for badge ideas. If I was looking for meeting plans or how to structure meetings or anything like that, I would want an area where their meetings are explained. As my troop is going to be using the site to keep track of our information, we need a section that includes important dates and activities that need planned out and accounnted for.

3. At first, I plan on only adding a few pages. I need a home page, one for meetings, one for important information, one for activities, one for badges (finished and unfinished ones), and maybe a page about my troop. I may add more in the future, but for now I will only start with a few.

4.

5. The structure that will best fit my website is hierarchical.
